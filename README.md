## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me continue to solidify basic html and css concepts. Though the project wasn't tough, it took me a while trying to get it was close as possible.

### Continued development

I try not to look for solutions online while working on the challenge, but instead look for resources that explain properties and what they do. Once I complete a project, I usually go back and try to build the challenge again, or something similar with my own ideas.
